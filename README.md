 Kaggle competetion: TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge
 
The complete data can be found in the original competetion page (https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection/discussion/53886). Here a subset of the data is being used only, and it is being provided in the train_sample folder.

The training has been done chunk-by-chunk to fit into small laptop memory. Models tested were Random Forest, Neural Networks, XGBoost and SVM. However, the code (in Python) only reflects the XGBoost model.
